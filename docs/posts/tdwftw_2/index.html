<p>Before going to any details I am trying to define this project in one sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collaborative choir of voices around the current experience of the pandemic in its multiple languages and perspetives - a shared experience that creates both a sense of community and empathy among the participants and listeners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was trying to organize this project that has no name yet, so I'll just call it echoes.</p>
<p>I was trying to separate it into segments, at first between 'the archive' and 'the experience'</p>
<h2>The Archive</h2>
<p>The archive consisting of the whole process of assembling the audios, creating the context for people to do so, develop the infrastructure for both navigation in these audios and perhaps an API to access the database.</p>
<h2>The Experience</h2>
<p>The experience consist of <em>what to do with those audio fragments</em></p>
<ul>
<li>what type of software/programming language do I use</li>
<li>how will it sound like</li>
<li>how to display it</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Goals</h2>
<p>With this project my interest is mainly in the experience, the theoretical references, how exacly the score sounds like, the archive itself, it is all <em>means to an end</em>, which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To create Empathy, a sense of community through the experience of your own voice among all others, through your language and understanding amongst all others you <em>do not</em> understand. A manner to take your voice from your private, isolated space and experience and make it resonate with the a larger view of things.</p>
