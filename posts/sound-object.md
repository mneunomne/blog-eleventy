1. A sonic entity is detected by its signal being picked up by the autonomous mechanism of hearing (ouïr)
2. The signalled sonic entity (having been detected) 'sound character' is deciphered by the active perception of listening (éncouter)
3. The signalled sonic entity is then subjected to a twofold focussed attention that judges then describes it (entendre)
4. The signalled sonic entities' significance is then understood by abstraction, comparison, deduction and by linking it to different sources and types (either the initial meaning is confirmed or if denied an additional meaning is worked out (comprendre).
