Paper Tiger Television (PTTV) is a non-profit video collective. Through the production and distribution of public and social video, community screenings, and grassroots advocacy, PTTV works to challenge and expose the corporate control of mainstream media. PTTV believes that increasing public awareness of the negative influence of mass media and involving people in the process of making media is mandatory for our long-term goal of information equity.
