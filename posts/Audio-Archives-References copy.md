[Canny edge detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)

> The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. 
It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works.
